    "**Q-1. A university wants to understand the relationship between the SAT scores of its applicants and their college GPA. They collect data on 500 students, including their SAT scores (out of 1600) and their college GPA (on a 4.0 scale). They find that the correlation coefficient between SAT scores and college GPA is 0.7. What does this correlation coefficient indicate about the relationship between SAT scores and college GPA?**"

    "Ans: The correlation coefficient of 0.7 reveals a robust positive correlation between SAT scores and college GPA. This coefficient, which falls within the range of -1 to 1, provides insight into the strength and direction of the relationship. In this scenario, the coefficient of 0.7 indicates a strong positive association, suggesting that higher SAT scores are typically accompanied by higher college GPAs.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is crucial to understand that correlation does not imply causation. While the correlation coefficient establishes a link between SAT scores and college GPA, it does not establish a cause-and-effect relationship. It is essential to consider other factors, such as individual study habits, motivation, and personal circumstances, which may also influence college GPA. Therefore, a comprehensive analysis should include these additional factors when interpreting the findings."

    "a. To determine the percentage of individuals in the dataset with heights between 160 cm and 180 cm, we can use the properties of the normal distribution. Since the dataset is approximately normally distributed with a mean height of 170 cm and a standard deviation of 10 cm, we can calculate the z-scores for the given heights.\n",
    "\n",
    "The z-score formula is: z = (x - μ) / σ, where x is the value, μ is the mean, and σ is the standard deviation.\n",
    "\n",
    "For 160 cm:\n",
    "z1 = (160 - 170) / 10 = -1\n",
    "\n",
    "For 180 cm:\n",
    "z2 = (180 - 170) / 10 = 1\n",
    "\n",
    "We can then use a standard normal distribution table or a calculator to find the corresponding cumulative probabilities for these z-scores. The cumulative probability for z = -1 is approximately 0.1587, and the cumulative probability for z = 1 is approximately 0.8413.\n",
    "\n",
    "To calculate the percentage between 160 cm and 180 cm, we subtract the lower cumulative probability from the higher cumulative probability and multiply by 100:\n",
    "Percentage = (0.8413 - 0.1587) * 100 = 68.26%\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, approximately 68.26% of individuals in the dataset have heights between 160 cm and 180 cm.\n",
    "\n",
    "b. When randomly selecting a sample of 100 individuals from the dataset, we can calculate the probability that their average height is greater than 175 cm. Since the sample size is relatively large (n = 100) and the dataset is approximately normally distributed, the distribution of sample means will also be approximately normal.\n",
    "\n",
    "The mean of the sample means will still be 170 cm, but the standard deviation of the sample means (also known as the standard error) will be equal to the population standard deviation divided by the square root of the sample size: σ / sqrt(n) = 10 / sqrt(100) = 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can now calculate the z-score for a sample mean of 175 cm:\n",
    "z = (x - μ) / (σ / sqrt(n)) = (175 - 170) / (1) = 5\n",
    "\n",
    "To find the probability associated with a z-score of 5, we consult a standard normal distribution table or use a calculator. The probability of obtaining a z-score greater than 5 is very close to 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the probability that the average height of a randomly selected sample of 100 individuals is greater than 175 cm is approximately 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "c. Assuming the dataset follows a normal distribution, we can calculate the z-score corresponding to a height of 185 cm using the formula: z = (x - μ) / σ.\n",
    "\n",
    "z = (185 - 170) / 10 = 1.5\n",
    "\n",
    "The z-score corresponding to a height of 185 cm is 1.5.\n",
    "\n",
    "d. If we know that 5% of the dataset has heights below a certain value, we can find the corresponding threshold height by finding the z-score associated with a cumulative probability of 0.05. \n",
    "\n",
    "From a standard normal distribution table or using a calculator, we find that the z-score associated with a cumulative probability of 0.05 is approximately -1.645.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can now use the formula z = (x - μ) / σ to solve for the threshold height (x):\n",
    "\n",
    "-1.645 = (x - 170) / 10\n",
    "\n",
    "Solving for x, we get:\n",
    "x - 170 = -1.645 * 10\n",
    "x - 170 = -16.45\n",
    "x = 170 - 16.45\n",
    "x ≈ 153.55\n",
    "\n",
    "The approximate height corresponding to the threshold where \n",
    "\n",
    "5% of the dataset has heights below it is approximately 153.55 cm.\n",
    "\n",
    "e. The coefficient of variation (CV) measures the relative variability of a dataset, taking into account the mean and standard deviation. It is calculated as the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean, expressed as a percentage:\n",
    "\n",
    "CV = (σ / μ) * 100\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, the mean height is 170 cm, and the standard deviation is 10 cm. Plugging these values into the formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "CV = (10 / 170) * 100 ≈ 5.88%\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the coefficient of variation for the dataset is approximately 5.88%.\n",
    "\n",
    "f. Skewness measures the asymmetry of a distribution. A skewness of approximately zero suggests that the dataset is close to being symmetrically distributed. In other words, the heights in the dataset are relatively evenly distributed around the mean without a significant skew to the left or right.\n",
    "\n",
    "This implies that the dataset does not exhibit a pronounced skew and has a relatively balanced distribution of heights."

    "**Q-12. A pharmaceutical company develops a new drug and wants to compare its effectiveness against a standard drug for treating a particular condition. They conduct a study with two groups: Group A receives the new drug, and Group B receives the standard drug. The company measures the improvement in a specific symptom for both groups after a 4-week treatment period. a. The company collects data from 30 patients in each group and calculates the mean improvement score and the standard deviation of improvement for each group. The mean improvement score for Group A is 2.5 with a standard deviation of 0.8, while the mean improvement score for Group B is 2.2 with a standard deviation of 0.6. Conduct a t-test to determine if there is a significant difference in the mean improvement scores between the two groups. Use a significance level of 0.05. b. Based on the t-test results, state whether the null hypothesis should be rejected or not. Provide a conclusion in the context of the study.**"
